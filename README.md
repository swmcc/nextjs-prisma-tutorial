# Fullstack Authentication Example with Next.js and NextAuth.js

## Description

Hello, I've decided to start this repository as a learning exercise to revisit
the basics of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

I've been working on another project where I encountered some issues, and
sometimes it's helpful to take a step back and review the fundamentals to
ensure I haven't missed any critical concepts. I believe that periodically
going back to basics, even on concepts that might seem mundane, can provide a
fresh perspective and offer solutions to ongoing problems.

This repository will follow an [online
tutorial](https://vercel.com/guides/nextjs-prisma-postgres) on Next.js and
Prisma, where I will be working through the steps and documenting my progress.
I'll also include some reflections and observations, and share any insights or
tips I find helpful along the way.

As developers, we're constantly growing and learning, and sometimes we need to
revisit the basics to reinforce our knowledge. This process can seem like
taking a step back, but in reality, it often allows us to take two steps
forward. Some examples where **"going back to school"** has helped people
include:

- *Refactoring Code:* Sometimes, revisiting basic principles of clean coding or
  design patterns can help streamline and improve the efficiency of a codebase.

- *Debugging:* Understanding the fundamental workings of a system can often
  give you the insight you need to find and fix a bug. 

- *Learning New Features:* Sometimes, going back to basics can help you better
  understand new features or updates in a technology. 

I believe, as we continue to learn and grow as developers, it's important to
realise that there is always something new to learn, no matter how experienced
we are. As Albert Einstein once said, *"Once you stop learning, you start
dying."* 

So, let's continue to learn and grow together. Every day is a school day.
